                        <p>Permanent cosmetic makeup is cosmetic tattooing. The specialized techniques used for permanent cosmetics are often referred to as “micropigmentation”, “micropigment implantation” or “dermagraphics”. The cosmetic implantation technique deposits colored pigment into the upper reticular layer of the dermis.</p>

                        <p>Permanent cosmetics procedures are performed using various devices, including the traditional tattoo coil machines, the pen or rotary machine (includes the digital rotary machines) and the non-machine or hand device. The process includes a consultation, the application of pigment, and at least one or more follow up visits for evaluating the healed design work and color of the pigment.</p>

                        <p>People who meet minimum age requirements and have the ability to heal properly from minor wounds can benefit from the liberating benefits of permanent cosmetics.Interest in this service spans the young to the more mature; those who desire a soft, natural enhancement to their appearance. It is especially  valuable to people who can’t wear traditional cosmetics due to allergies and skin sensitivities; active people who want to look their best for sports activities such as swimming, hiking, biking, tennis, aerobics; and those who don’t want to worry about “sweating off” or reapplying cosmetics.Permanent Cosmetics also benefits the vision challenged who have difficulty applying their cosmetics; and others with dexterity related conditions  such as arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke survivors, and busy people who don’t have time to spend applying and refreshing makeup throughout the day and evening.</p>

                        <p>Permanent cosmetics procedures are considered permanent because pigment is tattooed into the upper reticular part of the dermal layer of the skin and cannot be washed off. However, as with any tattoo or colorant (pigment) in general, fading can and often does occur, requiring periodic maintenance referred to as color re-enhancement or color refreshing. The scientific structure of pigments and the requirement for periodic refreshing is identical to that of tinted hair color; faded material on furniture that may be located near a window and subject to sun exposure; house paint that is exposed to the sun and other environmental elements; pigment implanted in the skin may fade with time.This colorant periodic maintenance requirement is a good opportunity to reevaluate one’s color and design preferences.  While the concept of permanent, without any change, may seem like a perfectly good idea, think about how your tastes have changed over the years.  From time to time likely you have made subtle or dramatic changes in your clothing preferences, your hair color and style, and if you wear topical makeup, those colors have changed as well.The fact that most people will require periodic color refreshing of their permanent cosmetics is the opportune time to work with your technician to reevaluate your overall appearance profile and determine if any changes are appropriate.Longevity varies from person to person depending on their lifestyle (sun exposure), the color(s) used for the permanent cosmetic procedure, and are also thought to be affected by topical products applied to the skin.</p>

                      <p>The initial procedure will generally take approximately 2 to 2 ½ hours; there are records to establish; photographs to take; desired design and color to discuss; the procedure to perform; and the aftercare requirements to discuss. Follow up or color refresher procedures usually do not require the same amount of time.</p>

                    <p>While eyebrows may show little after effect, eyeliner and lips may show slight to moderate swelling.  This is very dependent upon the amount of work performed.As examples; an eyelash enhancement will show very little response to the tattooing procedure compared to a more moderate response when wide eyeliner is performed.  The same philosophy applies to lip color procedures.  A lip liner or blended lip liner will show less effects of the procedure than that of a full lip color.  Also, some people swell more from minor skin infractions than others.During the procedure there may be some minor bleeding.  This again, is client specific.  Many people take blood thinners on a daily basis so some slight bleeding would be expected.  Others show little or no signs of bleeding.  Bruising is rare but again, if a person is on blood thinners, bruising could occur.  What is seen more often is that eyebrows rarely if ever produce any bruising; minor bruising during eyeliner procedures is possible if the skin being tattooed is very thin and close to the vascular system.  This also applies to lip procedures in the event the client is more mature.   If bruising does occur, typically it is minor and subsides in a few days.There is usually some tenderness for a few days. The color is much darker than you may expect for the first six to ten days.<br><br>Other less often reported side effects are difficult to determine due to the individuality of each person’s biological system.  This is why professional permanent cosmetic technicians require a client history profile be filled out to assess different factors that may contribute to your experience after the tattooing procedure has been completed.</p>

                    <p>People can develop an allergy to anything, anytime; however, pigment allergies are considered rare. Some doctors recommend that people with environmental allergies or allergies to conventional makeup have permanent cosmetic procedures because they can replace cosmetic products that people are sensitive to.  While allergic reactions to any type of tattooing pigments on the body or on the face through permanent cosmetics may occur at any point in time, they are extremely rare.  Ask your technician if their pigments meet their local jurisdictional requirements.  Also, SPCP pigment suppliers are required to list the ingredients on their pigment labels.</p>

                    <p>The possibility that you would have any problems or reactions from these procedures is almost non-existent with today’s health standards. SPCP member professionals are given continued opportunities for education in practicing precise methods of disinfection and sterilization.Post procedural instructions, if followed carefully, will greatly reduce any risk. Medical problems associated with permanent cosmetics are often linked to poor attention to the required aftercare process on behalf of the client.Choose a time for procedures when you feel confident you can follow the simple, but very important after care instructions.</p>

                    <p>Often the tattooed color is not perfect after the initial procedure heals. Permanent cosmetic procedures are a process and at least one follow-up to the initial procedure should be scheduled.It is recommended that any required detail work to the original procedure be performed no sooner than four weeks after the original procedure.The minimum standard for follow-up detail work for lip procedures is six weeks.  Lips have a different healing agenda than procedures performed on other parts of the face due to their delicate nature.The cited time frames will vary depending on the health profile and age of the client, but these are good minimum standards for consideration.</p>

                    <p>Numerous studies have shown that even for people who have large body tattoos there is little to no potential for irritation resulting from an MRI.In the rare instance where discomfort resulted, it was localized and very temporary. However, with that said, it is prudent to advise your MRI technician that you have permanent cosmetics.</p>
